Hi! My name is Scott Wetterschneider and I'm a toy designer, sculptor and illustrator.

I'm sharing this and other assets, including base geometry, ZBrush materials, etc. simply to give back to the artistic community in general, the same community that has given me support for too many years to count.

You can find more of my work in the usual places:
